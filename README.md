# Prediction of Diabetes
Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder, is one of the fastest growing diseases regardless of geographic, racial, or ethnic context. There are two types of disbetes: Type I and Type II. 

- Type I diabetes happens when the pancreatic beta cells produce either very little insulin or no insulin.
- Type II dibetes happens when body become insulin resistance.

The common symptoms for Type I diabetes are sudden weight loss, Dehydration, delayed healing, blurred vision and Type II have similar symptoms or no symptoms at all depends on body reaction. [1, 2]. Type I diabetes strikes both kids and adults at any age.There is no cure for Diabetes but it can be managed if it diagnose in early stage. Type I diabetes can be managed by medication and Type II can be managed by balanced diet, excercise and a healthy lifestyle. In this project, we will be dealing exclusively with data about Type II diabetic patients. 

# Why we have selected "Prediction of Diabetes" topic

8.7% of males and 7.6% of females in Canada, equaling roughly three million individuals, had Type II diabetes in the year 2014 [4]. Nationally, in the year 2014, the incidence of new diabetes cases in the population was 5.9 out of every 1000 people [4]. Total health care costs resulting from diabetes in Canada is expected to increase to over $16.9 billion (CAD) anually by 2020. We would like to create a machine learning model that can correlationally predict whether or not an individual is at risk for Type II Diabetes based on a range of health features, in order to aid clinicians in preventing and treating the illness.

# Description of Data

The dataset contains a record of 16 attributes about each of 520 patients, which may be correlated with their diabetic status, or "class". The data was collected from the patients in the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital of Sylhet, Bangladesh.

# Questions to answer with this data

To what extent can a machine-learning model predict whether or not a patient is at risk of diabetes based on 16 different health and demographic attributes? Is such a model useful for classifying patients in a clinical setting so that preventative and if nescessary, therapeutic measures may be implemented?
