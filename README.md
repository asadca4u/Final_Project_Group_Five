# Prediction of Diabetes
Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder, is one of the fastest growing disease regardless of geographic, racial, or ethnic context. There are two types of disbetes: Type 1 and Type 2. 
- Type 1 diabetes happens when the pancreatic beta cells produce either very little insulin or no insulin.
- Type 2 dibetes happens when body become insulin resistance. 
The common symptoms for Type 1 diabetes are sudden weight loss, Dehydration, delayed healing, blurred vision and Type 2 have similar symptoms or no symptoms at all depends on body reaction. [1, 2]. Type 1 diabetes strikes both kids and adults at any age.There is no cure for Diabetes but it can be managed if it diagnose in early stage. Type 1 diabetes can be manged by medication and Type 2 can be manged by health diete, excercise and healthy life style. 
# Why we have selected "Prediction of Diabetes" topic
300,000 plus Canadians may have Type 1 diabetes and nationally the average rates has been growing at an estimated 5.1% per year. Total health care costs resulting from diabetes in Canada is expected to increase to over $16.9 billion (CAD) anually by 2020. we want to create a system, which can help diagonosing early stage of diabetes with symptoms.[3]
# Description of Data
The data set contains reports of diabetes related symptoms of 520 people. The data was collected from the patients in the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital of Sylhet, Bangladesh.[4]

# Questions to answer with this data
With this particular diabetes dataset, we like to diagnose the possitive and negative diabetes in male and female with the listed symptoms.
# Description of Communication Protocols
Logistic Regression, Random Forest algorithm and Decision Trees will be performed on the diabetes symptoms dataset to predict the model and accuracy. The predicted model will be connected to PostgreSQL for data end users. The data propcessing and performing the model will be done in Jupyter notebook.
